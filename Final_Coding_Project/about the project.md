This project is about measuring the demographic growth on three cities, this works by counting the red pixels on a specific hue proyected by the red waterproofing on buildings, this is the best way to count the buildings growth as that hue of red is very rare in nature.
Besides the cities selected are not on a zone where that red is available. 

This code loops through 16 images across 5 years and 3 cities chosen by me. The code makes the image black and white to better visualize the demographic change and it adds a visual aid to better view which parts of the image are counted as parat of the civilization.
The black and white image is then stripped from the civilization part, leaving only the part unscathed from humans. 
Finally the code plots a line graph to show the growth on each city and it is compared to the other cities. This code was proven to be effective as the graphs lined up with the census population for each city/province at the time the satelite were taken.
